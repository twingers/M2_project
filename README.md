Time series analysis is used widely in business.  This project was born out of a work-related problem that started with trend analysis related to water quality analysis for a customer.  However, my experience with time series was limited with Python.  Therefore, I have spent some of my free time reading a couple of books on time series analysis including "Practical TIme Series Analysis" by Aileen Nielsen and "Time Series Forecasting in Python" by Marco Peixeiro.

For this project, the price of gold will be related to the Dow Jones Industrial Average using statistical analysis that includes time series analysis and forecasting.
